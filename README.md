## Background
Recently I was discussing with my friends how it would be nice to keep better track of my bucketlist, but make it a litle more intelligent so that you could sort and filter by places, location, etc. For the purpose of this demo, made a simple page to create new bucketlist items, and then view all items in a table sortable by column.

### Stack
I forked the Remix Indie stack to get started, this is my first time using Remix, Prisma, and Tailwin. 

### TODO
Still TODO: cleaning up code, getting ride of unused Indie stack boilerplate, improving UI, moving "create" button into index route

### How to run
After forking repo: 
- `npm install`
- `npx prisma db seed`
- `npm run dev`
